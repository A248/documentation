Getting started with Velocity
=============================

Velocity is refreshingly easy to set up.

.. warning:: Velocity is in an alpha-quality state and is not yet suitable for production use.


Installing Java
---------------

Velocity is built on Java, so if you do not already have Java installed, you
will need to install it before you continue. A discussion about installing Java
is out of scope for the Velocity documentation to cover.

Downloading Velocity
--------------------

You will need to download Velocity first. Visit the `download page <https://www.velocitypowered.com/downloads>`_
and download the latest proxy build from it. Place the downloaded JAR file
into a directory just for your proxy. Afterwards, you can run the JAR using
``java -jar velocity-proxy-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar``.

What's Next?
------------

When you first run Velocity, it will produce a file called ``velocity.toml``.
In the next section, we will be going over this file and the settings inside
it.
